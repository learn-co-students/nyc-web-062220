  * MVC
    - Models
    - Views
    - Controllers
  * ERB 
  * How RESTful routes map to CRUD actions

## Introduction to the internet

* What is the internet?

  Internet - Hardware
  Web - Software - different versions of the "Web"


  * How is data sent over the internet?
  * TCP - Transmission Control Protocol -> how data gets sent
  * IP - Internet Protocol, IP Adress -> where
  * HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol - what kind of data
  * HTML - HyperText Markup Language

* How can I find out the IP address of www.google.com using a terminal command? What kind of server makes this lookup possible?
  * DNS (Domain Name System)
  * `nslookup`
  * https://iplocation.com/

  * What's the difference between static and dynamic websites? What are some of the benefits of a dynamic website?

  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee
  * http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html


* What is a server? What is a client?
* With a client and server, which makes the request? Which sends the response?

* What is the request / response cycle?
  - Anatomy of Request:
    - path: (HTTP Verb/URL)
      - GET POST PATCH/PUT DELETE
    - Headers: - Meta Data - comunication between browser and Server
    - Body: core data sent back by user 

  - Anatomy of Response:
   - headers: address
   - Status Codes: 
   - body: HTML/CSS Core content

  


* What is a HTTP request? Make a few, using at least two of these tools: Google Chrome, Postman, curl

* What are the parts of a HTTP request
  * Use a web browser to find the headers for an HTTP request. What do you think these headers do?
  * What is usually in the body of an HTTP _response_?
  * What is a HTTP status code? What do the codes 200, 404, 500, 503, 302, 422 and 418 mean?
    * https://http.cat/
  * Why do we use HTTP verbs? What is the difference between what GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests do?
  * What is a URL? Which part of a URL is the scheme (protocol)? Where is the host? The port? The path? Query string?  What is the purpose of each of these parts?
