## Instructions

You're going to be building out a Gif search using the Giphy API. In this lab, 
there are no tests to pass. Rather, your task is to create a working app in
your browser using the instructions below. When finished, you should have an
application that can take in a user's input, fetch JSON data from the Giphy API,
and display the results. As there are no tests, to register completion, run `learn submit`.

## Getting Started

The URL for the API is

`https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=YOUR QUERY HERE&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&rating=g`

While the above API key _may_ work, we recommend creating your own API key by 
following the [nstructions on Giphy's developer site][create_key]. Creating a key is free
and only requires an account. Using your own key will prevent any potential rate limiting if other 
students are also working on this lesson.

[create_key]: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide

Once you've got your key, you should be able to access the Giphy API from a browser and receive
a JSON response to confirm everything is working.

`https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=dolphin&api_key=YOUR API KEY&rating=g`

You should get back an array of objects, each containing information about a particular image.

```js
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "gif",
      "id": "l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "slug": "bbc-wildlife-l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "url": "https://giphy.com/gifs/bbc-wildlife-l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva",
      "bitly_gif_url": "https://gph.is/2iC32M8",
      "bitly_url": "https://gph.is/2iC32M8",

      ...

      "images": {
        "fixed_height_still": {
          "url": "https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva/200_s.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5b9fa2866168584b51f13892",
          "width": "400",
          "height": "200",
          "size": "55556"
        },
        ...
        "original": {
          "url": "https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0HlNQ03J5JxX6lva/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5b9fa2866168584b51f13892",
          "width": "480",
          "height": "240",
        }
        ...
      }
    }
    ]
```

**Note:** Notice there are many URL keys on each image object. The first `url`
key, just below `type`, `id`, and `slug` will bring you to the images page on
[giphy.com](giphy.com). We only want the path to the actual image, which found
at `images.original.url`. Using other `url` keys may cause CORS issues.

### Your Components

#### `<App/>`

Your top level component will be the `<App />` component-- no surprises there!
It will be responsible for rendering the `<NavBar />` component (this component
is already provided for you, note the project has bootstrap loaded in) and the
`<GifListContainer />` component

#### `<GifListContainer />`

`<GifListContainer />` should be a container that does data fetching and then renders its corresponding sub-component. Thatâ€™s it.

> If you haven't learned about container vs presentation components yet, don't worry. We'll dig deeper into them soon enough. For now, just know that container components _container_ other components. They themselves usually aren't visibly on the page. Presentational components, on the other hand, are components can you _can_ visibly see on the page (like our `Navbar`).

In our app, the `<GifListContainer />` will be responsible for fetching the data
from the giphy API, storing the first 3 gifs from the response in its component
**state**, and passing that data down to its child, the `<GifList>` component, as
a prop.

It will also render a `<GifSearch />` component that renders the form.
`<GifListContainer />` should pass down a submit handler function to `<GifSearch />`
as a prop.

#### `<GifList />`

`<GifList />` is a _presentational_ component. It receives data from its props
and renders html given the input data. It can render a top level `<ul>` with
each gif as an `<li>`.

#### `<GifSearch />`

The `<GifSearch />` component will render a form that receives the user input
for the giphy search. The text input should be a _controlled component_ that
stores the value of the input in its component state and renders the DOM
accordingly. The React component is always in charge of what the DOM looks like.

`<GifSearch />` should receive a callback prop from its parent. On a submit
event, it should invoke that callback prop with the value of the text input. It
is this callback function, defined in `<GifListContainer />`, that will actually
query the API with the text the user has entered.

When finished, submit your work using `learn submit`.

> **Note**: You may notice that Dan Abramov, one of the original proponents of 
> using Container components, has added a more recent note recommending against them.
> It is true that there are newer approaches to writing React apps that reduce the
> need for having components specialize. However, while we're practicing the basics
> of React, becoming familiar with how components form a tree and pass data from
> parent to child is highly valuable. For this reason, we'll keep our components
> separated here.
