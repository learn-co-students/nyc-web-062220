# Deliverables

 - Add a create form so a user can add their own gif to the Index (do not worry about the new object having an id)
  - Add a responsive search form for the BeyContainer that allows me to filter the BeyCards by name
Bonus:
	- refactor your search form so that it searches the ENTIRE application
      - This means that when you search for the name of a gif, both the BeyContainer AND the Favorites should filter through their lists
